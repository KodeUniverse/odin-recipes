        Japanese curry, also known as "Kare Raisu," is a popular Japanese dish 
        that consists of a thick, savory curry sauce served over rice. 
        Japanese curry is different from other curries in that it is less 
        spicy and has a sweeter taste. It is typically made with a blend of 
        curry powder, soy sauce, and other seasonings, and can be customized 
        with a variety of meats and vegetables. Japanese curry is a hearty and 
        comforting meal that is perfect for cold weather or any time you 
        crave a warm and satisfying meal. It is a versatile dish that can 
        be customized to your liking by adding different meats and vegetables, 
        and its mild and sweet flavor makes it a great option for those who are 
        sensitive to spicy foods.
