            <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 (14 oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Instructions:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, ginger, 
                garlic, cumin, paprika, turmeric, garam masala, 
                cayenne pepper, and salt. Add the chicken pieces and toss to coat. 
                Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Line a baking sheet with foil 
                and place the marinated chicken pieces on the sheet. 
                Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked 
                through and lightly charred.</li>
            <li>
                In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. 
                Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. 
                Add the crushed tomatoes and cook for another 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the baked chicken pieces to the skillet with the tomato mixture 
                and stir to coat the chicken. Pour in the heavy cream and bring 
                the mixture to a simmer. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring 
                occasionally, until the sauce has thickened.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the cilantro leaves and serve hot with rice or naan bread.
            </li>
        </ol>
